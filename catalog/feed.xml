&lt;p&gt;There is a great big wacky rainbow world out there in the universe, and Shooti—our spaceship-shaped friend and hero— must travel through it all to finally come back home! In a psychedelic starway filled with aliens, treasure, heroes and all sorts of fluffy friends, our hero will valiantly clash, jump and roll, with the choice to either avoid incoming danger, or dutifully bring on justice by laser gun. Will you help Shooti survive in this crazy scrolling highway of oncoming traffic, space debris and technicolor lunacy? We wish you the best luck on your voyage thru the stars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesmerize Games proudly presents RetroShooti, a space dreams shoot’em up game by MarsCat, featuring an original chiptunes soundtrack by her project Lucca! Take a trigger-happy space trip across +15 levels and face against +4 bosses on your journey, or play together with friends in the many co-operative and competitive party modes!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mesmerize Games</name></author><category term="videogame" /><summary type="html">SHOOTI RIDES OUT ON A NEW SPACE ADVENTURE!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shootris</title><link href="https://mesmerize.games/catalog/shootris.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shootris" /><published>2017-03-18T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2017-03-18T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>https://mesmerize.games/catalog/shootris</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mesmerize.games/catalog/shootris.html">&lt;p&gt;this is gaem your spaceship go pewpew and the bloc come down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could mean finally having funds, but the hospital is a mess! Recently, a virus outbreak is making everyone on the building sick. Add roaming animals on the floors and reckless porters running on the aisles and you have a recipe for chaos. Surely you can’t present the hospital like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for you, you count with the help of your friends: Dr. Belmont, a skilled chemist that developed an almost-miraculous vaccine that can cure almost anything on one dose, and Nurse Morris, who’s eagerly waiting to supply you with more vaccines as you call for her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put some order on the hospital and get that funding!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mesmerize Games</name></author><category term="videogame" /><summary type="html">You’re Dr. Hilton, and your shift on the hospital just got crazy when Mr. Kent, a millionaire philanthropist, announces he wants to come for a visit!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rescue in Faraway Fields</title><link href="https://mesmerize.games/catalog/rescue-in-faraway-fields.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rescue in Faraway Fields" /><published>2015-09-14T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2015-09-14T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>https://mesmerize.games/catalog/rescue-in-faraway-fields</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mesmerize.games/catalog/rescue-in-faraway-fields.html">&lt;p&gt;Faraway Fields is in danger!
